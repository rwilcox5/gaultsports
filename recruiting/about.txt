Alabama can get just about any player they want. So if Alabama is recruiting someone then it just makes sense to assume that he worth at least 4 stars. But then how do we ever know how good their class is if rankings are based on the assumption that the class is going to be good. The tendency to take Nick Saban's word that a player he recruits is really good is a weakness of regular recruiting rankings, but what if this assumption could be used for good to create an unbiased ranking.

Any evaluation of a player is going to be biased. The people making the evaluations might genuinely assume that SEC recruits are superior. Or maybe they know that there are millions of SEC fans who will patronize the publications that are correct, and of course putting their school as high as possible is always correct. Or they simply are blinded by an affinity for speed or strength or highlight catches. But publications are almost never blamed for incorrect evaluations. Recruiting classes that bomb are generally deemed to be the fault of bad coaching rather than being overrated by some website. And coaches will always take the credit for developing 2 star prospects rather than accept that maybe they were underrated out of high school.

Who makes evaluations of players and are held accountable for their scouting abilities? Coaches. So maybe we can develop a system to rank classes based on data from the coaches themselves on who is good and who is really good.

Okay so let me explain how our rankings work. Most players are offered by multiple schools. The key is to consider the school that gets a commitment as the winner and the other schools as losers. Then we can use a variety of methods to convert this win-loss data into rankings just like if they were games on the field.
